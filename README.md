You can run the gpt2 chat model here, it only works as a training and test environment

To run it locally, you need to install it:
If you are using windows then install this via PowerShell in administrator mode:
pip install transformers torch

pip install flask
Then start the server:
python app.py
Then you will get http://127.0.0.1:5000 click and try to test
